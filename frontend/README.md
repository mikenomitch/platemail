# Platemail Frontend

See main README for a description of what comprises the frontend.

### Next Steps

- Libraries to consider:

  - Ramda
  - Recompose (or just use hooks w/ preact hooks lib)
  - Normalizer
  - Date-fns
  - i18n library

- Consider implementing GraphQL with Apollo. If so, potentially
  replace redux with smaller lib (redux-zero) as it won't need
  to do heavy lifting.
