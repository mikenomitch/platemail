This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Adding Images, Fonts, and Files

With Webpack, using static assets like images and fonts works similarly to CSS.

You can **`import` a file right in a TypeScript module**. This tells Webpack to include that file in the bundle. Unlike CSS imports, importing a file gives you a string value. This value is the final path you can reference in your code, e.g. as the `src` attribute of an image or the `href` of a link to a PDF.

To reduce the number of requests to the server, importing images that are less than 10,000 bytes returns a [data URI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs) instead of a path. This applies to the following file extensions: bmp, gif, jpg, jpeg, and png. SVG files are excluded due to [#1153](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/1153).

Before getting started, you must define each type of asset as a valid module format. Otherwise, the TypeScript compiler will generate an error like this:

> Cannot find module './logo.png'.

To import asset files in TypeScript, create a new type definition file in your project, and name it something like `assets.d.ts`. Then, add a line for each type of asset that you need to import:

```ts
declare module "*.gif";
declare module "*.jpg";
declare module "*.jpeg";
declare module "*.png";
declare module "*.svg";
```

(you'll have to restart the compiler in order the changes to take place)

In this case, we've added several image file extensions as valid module formats.

Now that the compiler is configured, here is an example of importing an image file:

```js
import React from "react";
import logo from "./logo.svg"; // Tell Webpack this JS file uses this image

console.log(logo); // /logo.84287d09.png

function Header() {
  // Import result is the URL of your image
  return <img src={logo} alt="Logo" />;
}

export default Header;
```

This ensures that when the project is built, Webpack will correctly move the images into the build folder, and provide us with correct paths.

This works in CSS too:

```css
.Logo {
  background-image: url(./logo.png);
}
```

Webpack finds all relative module references in CSS (they start with `./`) and replaces them with the final paths from the compiled bundle. If you make a typo or accidentally delete an important file, you will see a compilation error, just like when you import a non-existent JavaScript module. The final filenames in the compiled bundle are generated by Webpack from content hashes. If the file content changes in the future, Webpack will give it a different name in production so you don’t need to worry about long-term caching of assets.

Please be advised that this is also a custom feature of Webpack.

**It is not required for React** but many people enjoy it (and React Native uses a similar mechanism for images).<br>
An alternative way of handling static assets is described in the next section.

### Adding Assets Outside of the Module System

You can also add other assets to the `public` folder.

Note that we normally encourage you to `import` assets in JavaScript files instead.
For example, see the sections on [adding a stylesheet](#adding-a-stylesheet) and [adding images and fonts](#adding-images-fonts-and-files).
This mechanism provides a number of benefits:

- Scripts and stylesheets get minified and bundled together to avoid extra network requests.
- Missing files cause compilation errors instead of 404 errors for your users.
- Result filenames include content hashes so you don’t need to worry about browsers caching their old versions.

However there is an **escape hatch** that you can use to add an asset outside of the module system.

If you put a file into the `public` folder, it will **not** be processed by Webpack. Instead it will be copied into the build folder untouched. To reference assets in the `public` folder, you need to use a special variable called `PUBLIC_URL`.

Inside `index.html`, you can use it like this:

```html
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico">
```

Only files inside the `public` folder will be accessible by `%PUBLIC_URL%` prefix. If you need to use a file from `src` or `node_modules`, you’ll have to copy it there to explicitly specify your intention to make this file a part of the build.

When you run `npm run build`, Create React App will substitute `%PUBLIC_URL%` with a correct absolute path so your project works even if you use client-side routing or host it at a non-root URL.

In JavaScript code, you can use `process.env.PUBLIC_URL` for similar purposes:

```js
render() {
  // Note: this is an escape hatch and should be used sparingly!
  // Normally we recommend using `import` for getting asset URLs
  // as described in “Adding Images and Fonts” above this section.
  return <img src={process.env.PUBLIC_URL + '/img/logo.png'} />;
}
```

Keep in mind the downsides of this approach:

- None of the files in `public` folder get post-processed or minified.
- Missing files will not be called at compilation time, and will cause 404 errors for your users.
- Result filenames won’t include content hashes so you’ll need to add query arguments or rename them every time they change.

### When to Use the `public` Folder

Normally we recommend importing [stylesheets](#adding-a-stylesheet), [images, and fonts](#adding-images-fonts-and-files) from JavaScript.
The `public` folder is useful as a workaround for a number of less common cases:

- You need a file with a specific name in the build output, such as [`manifest.webmanifest`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest).
- You have thousands of images and need to dynamically reference their paths.
- You want to include a small script like [`pace.js`](http://github.hubspot.com/pace/docs/welcome/) outside of the bundled code.
- Some library may be incompatible with Webpack and you have no other option but to include it as a `<script>` tag.

Note that if you add a `<script>` that declares global variables, you also need to read the next section on using them.

## Using Global Variables

When you include a script in the HTML file that defines global variables and try to use one of these variables in the code, the linter will complain because it cannot see the definition of the variable.

You can avoid this by reading the global variable explicitly from the `window` object, for example:

```js
const $ = window.$;
```

This makes it obvious you are using a global variable intentionally rather than because of a typo.

Alternatively, you can force the linter to ignore any line by adding `// eslint-disable-line` after it.

## Adding Custom Environment Variables

> Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.2.3` and higher.

Your project can consume variables declared in your environment as if they were declared locally in your JS files. By
default you will have `NODE_ENV` defined for you, and any other environment variables starting with
`REACT_APP_`.

**The environment variables are embedded during the build time**. Since Create React App produces a static HTML/CSS/JS bundle, it can’t possibly read them at runtime. To read them at runtime, you would need to load HTML into memory on the server and replace placeholders in runtime, just like [described here](#injecting-data-from-the-server-into-the-page). Alternatively you can rebuild the app on the server anytime you change them.

> Note: You must create custom environment variables beginning with `REACT_APP_`. Any other variables except `NODE_ENV` will be ignored to avoid accidentally [exposing a private key on the machine that could have the same name](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/865#issuecomment-252199527). Changing any environment variables will require you to restart the development server if it is running.

These environment variables will be defined for you on `process.env`. For example, having an environment
variable named `REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE` will be exposed in your JS as `process.env.REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE`.

There is also a special built-in environment variable called `NODE_ENV`. You can read it from `process.env.NODE_ENV`. When you run `npm start`, it is always equal to `'development'`, when you run `npm test` it is always equal to `'test'`, and when you run `npm run build` to make a production bundle, it is always equal to `'production'`. **You cannot override `NODE_ENV` manually.** This prevents developers from accidentally deploying a slow development build to production.

These environment variables can be useful for displaying information conditionally based on where the project is
deployed or consuming sensitive data that lives outside of version control.

First, you need to have environment variables defined. For example, let’s say you wanted to consume a secret defined
in the environment inside a `<form>`:

```jsx
render() {
  return (
    <div>
      <small>You are running this application in <b>{process.env.NODE_ENV}</b> mode.</small>
      <form>
        <input type="hidden" defaultValue={process.env.REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE} />
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

During the build, `process.env.REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE` will be replaced with the current value of the `REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE` environment variable. Remember that the `NODE_ENV` variable will be set for you automatically.

When you load the app in the browser and inspect the `<input>`, you will see its value set to `abcdef`, and the bold text will show the environment provided when using `npm start`:

```html
<div>
  <small>You are running this application in <b>development</b> mode.</small>
  <form>
    <input type="hidden" value="abcdef" />
  </form>
</div>
```

The above form is looking for a variable called `REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE` from the environment. In order to consume this
value, we need to have it defined in the environment. This can be done using two ways: either in your shell or in
a `.env` file. Both of these ways are described in the next few sections.

Having access to the `NODE_ENV` is also useful for performing actions conditionally:

```js
if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production") {
  analytics.disable();
}
```

When you compile the app with `npm run build`, the minification step will strip out this condition, and the resulting bundle will be smaller.

### Referencing Environment Variables in the HTML

> Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.9.0` and higher.

You can also access the environment variables starting with `REACT_APP_` in the `public/index.html`. For example:

```html
<title>%REACT_APP_WEBSITE_NAME%</title>
```

Note that the caveats from the above section apply:

- Apart from a few built-in variables (`NODE_ENV` and `PUBLIC_URL`), variable names must start with `REACT_APP_` to work.
- The environment variables are injected at build time. If you need to inject them at runtime, [follow this approach instead](#generating-dynamic-meta-tags-on-the-server).

### Adding Temporary Environment Variables In Your Shell

Defining environment variables can vary between OSes. It’s also important to know that this manner is temporary for the
life of the shell session.

#### Linux, macOS (Bash)

```bash
REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE=abcdef npm start
```

### Adding Development Environment Variables In `.env`

> Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.5.0` and higher.

To define permanent environment variables, create a file called `.env` in the root of your project:

```
REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE=abcdef
```

> Note: You must create custom environment variables beginning with `REACT_APP_`. Any other variables except `NODE_ENV` will be ignored to avoid [accidentally exposing a private key on the machine that could have the same name](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/865#issuecomment-252199527). Changing any environment variables will require you to restart the development server if it is running.

`.env` files **should be** checked into source control (with the exclusion of `.env*.local`).

#### What other `.env` files are can be used?

> Note: this feature is **available with `react-scripts@1.0.0` and higher**.

- `.env`: Default.
- `.env.local`: Local overrides. **This file is loaded for all environments except test.**
- `.env.development`, `.env.test`, `.env.production`: Environment-specific settings.
- `.env.development.local`, `.env.test.local`, `.env.production.local`: Local overrides of environment-specific settings.

Files on the left have more priority than files on the right:

- `npm start`: `.env.development.local`, `.env.development`, `.env.local`, `.env`
- `npm run build`: `.env.production.local`, `.env.production`, `.env.local`, `.env`
- `npm test`: `.env.test.local`, `.env.test`, `.env` (note `.env.local` is missing)

These variables will act as the defaults if the machine does not explicitly set them.<br>
Please refer to the [dotenv documentation](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) for more details.

> Note: If you are defining environment variables for development, your CI and/or hosting platform will most likely need
> these defined as well. Consult their documentation how to do this. For example, see the documentation for [Travis CI](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/) or [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars).

#### Expanding Environment Variables In `.env`

> Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@1.1.0` and higher.

Expand variables already on your machine for use in your `.env` file (using [dotenv-expand](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv-expand)).

For example, to get the environment variable `npm_package_version`:

```
REACT_APP_VERSION=$npm_package_version
# also works:
# REACT_APP_VERSION=${npm_package_version}
```

Or expand variables local to the current `.env` file:

```
DOMAIN=www.example.com
REACT_APP_FOO=$DOMAIN/foo
REACT_APP_BAR=$DOMAIN/bar
```

## Pre-Rendering into Static HTML Files

If you’re hosting your `build` with a static hosting provider you can use [react-snapshot](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-snapshot) to generate HTML pages for each route, or relative link, in your application. These pages will then seamlessly become active, or “hydrated”, when the JavaScript bundle has loaded.

There are also opportunities to use this outside of static hosting, to take the pressure off the server when generating and caching routes.

The primary benefit of pre-rendering is that you get the core content of each page _with_ the HTML payload—regardless of whether or not your JavaScript bundle successfully downloads. It also increases the likelihood that each route of your application will be picked up by search engines.

You can read more about [zero-configuration pre-rendering (also called snapshotting) here](https://medium.com/superhighfives/an-almost-static-stack-6df0a2791319).

## Running Tests

> Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.3.0` and higher.<br> >[Read the migration guide to learn how to enable it in older projects!](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#migrating-from-023-to-030)

Create React App uses [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) as its test runner. To prepare for this integration, we did a [major revamp](https://facebook.github.io/jest/blog/2016/09/01/jest-15.html) of Jest so if you heard bad things about it years ago, give it another try.

Jest is a Node-based runner. This means that the tests always run in a Node environment and not in a real browser. This lets us enable fast iteration speed and prevent flakiness.

While Jest provides browser globals such as `window` thanks to [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom), they are only approximations of the real browser behavior. Jest is intended to be used for unit tests of your logic and your components rather than the DOM quirks.

We recommend that you use a separate tool for browser end-to-end tests if you need them. They are beyond the scope of Create React App.

### Filename Conventions

Jest will look for test files with any of the following popular naming conventions:

- Files with `.js` suffix in `__tests__` folders.
- Files with `.test.js` suffix.
- Files with `.spec.js` suffix.

The `.test.js` / `.spec.js` files (or the `__tests__` folders) can be located at any depth under the `src` top level folder.

We recommend to put the test files (or `__tests__` folders) next to the code they are testing so that relative imports appear shorter. For example, if `App.test.js` and `App.js` are in the same folder, the test just needs to `import App from './App'` instead of a long relative path. Colocation also helps find tests more quickly in larger projects.

### Command Line Interface

When you run `npm test`, Jest will launch in the watch mode. Every time you save a file, it will re-run the tests, just like `npm start` recompiles the code.

The watcher includes an interactive command-line interface with the ability to run all tests, or focus on a search pattern. It is designed this way so that you can keep it open and enjoy fast re-runs. You can learn the commands from the “Watch Usage” note that the watcher prints after every run:

![Jest watch mode](http://facebook.github.io/jest/img/blog/15-watch.gif)

### Writing Tests

To create tests, add `it()` (or `test()`) blocks with the name of the test and its code. You may optionally wrap them in `describe()` blocks for logical grouping but this is neither required nor recommended.

Jest provides a built-in `expect()` global function for making assertions. A basic test could look like this:

```js
import sum from "./sum";

it("sums numbers", () => {
  expect(sum(1, 2)).toEqual(3);
  expect(sum(2, 2)).toEqual(4);
});
```

All `expect()` matchers supported by Jest are [extensively documented here](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/expect.html).<br>
You can also use [`jest.fn()` and `expect(fn).toBeCalled()`](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/expect.html#tohavebeencalled) to create “spies” or mock functions.

### Testing Components

There is a broad spectrum of component testing techniques. They range from a “smoke test” verifying that a component renders without throwing, to shallow rendering and testing some of the output, to full rendering and testing component lifecycle and state changes.

Different projects choose different testing tradeoffs based on how often components change, and how much logic they contain. If you haven’t decided on a testing strategy yet, we recommend that you start with creating simple smoke tests for your components:

```ts
import * as React from "react";
import * as ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./App";

it("renders without crashing", () => {
  const div = document.createElement("div");
  ReactDOM.render(<App />, div);
});
```

This test mounts a component and makes sure that it didn’t throw during rendering. Tests like this provide a lot of value with very little effort so they are great as a starting point, and this is the test you will find in `src/App.test.tsx`.

When you encounter bugs caused by changing components, you will gain a deeper insight into which parts of them are worth testing in your application. This might be a good time to introduce more specific tests asserting specific expected output or behavior.

If you’d like to test components in isolation from the child components they render, we recommend using [`shallow()` rendering API](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/shallow.html) from [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/). To install it, run:

```sh
npm install --save-dev enzyme @types/enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16 @types/enzyme-adapter-react-16 react-test-renderer @types/react-test-renderer
```

Alternatively you may use `yarn`:

```sh
yarn add --dev enzyme @types/enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16 @types/enzyme-adapter-react-16 react-test-renderer @types/react-test-renderer
```

#### `src/setupTests.ts`

```ts
import * as Enzyme from "enzyme";
import * as Adapter from "enzyme-adapter-react-16";

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

> Note: Keep in mind that if you decide to "eject" before creating `src/setupTests.js`, the resulting `package.json` file won't contain any reference to it. [Read here](#initializing-test-environment) to learn how to add this after ejecting.

Now you can write a smoke test with it:

```ts
import * as React from "react";
import { shallow } from "enzyme";
import App from "./App";

it("renders without crashing", () => {
  shallow(<App />);
});
```

Unlike the previous smoke test using `ReactDOM.render()`, this test only renders `<App>` and doesn’t go deeper. For example, even if `<App>` itself renders a `<Button>` that throws, this test will pass. Shallow rendering is great for isolated unit tests, but you may still want to create some full rendering tests to ensure the components integrate correctly. Enzyme supports [full rendering with `mount()`](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/mount.html), and you can also use it for testing state changes and component lifecycle.

You can read the [Enzyme documentation](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/) for more testing techniques. Enzyme documentation uses Chai and Sinon for assertions but you don’t have to use them because Jest provides built-in `expect()` and `jest.fn()` for spies.

Here is an example from Enzyme documentation that asserts specific output, rewritten to use Jest matchers:

```ts
import * as React from "react";
import { shallow } from "enzyme";
import App from "./App";

it("renders welcome message", () => {
  const wrapper = shallow(<App />);
  const welcome = <h2>Welcome to React</h2>;
  // expect(wrapper.contains(welcome)).to.equal(true);
  expect(wrapper.contains(welcome)).toEqual(true);
});
```

All Jest matchers are [extensively documented here](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/expect.html).<br>
Nevertheless you can use a third-party assertion library like [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) if you want to, as described below.

Additionally, you might find [jest-enzyme](https://github.com/blainekasten/enzyme-matchers) helpful to simplify your tests with readable matchers. The above `contains` code can be written more simply with jest-enzyme.

```js
expect(wrapper).toContainReact(welcome);
```

To enable this, install `jest-enzyme`:

```sh
npm install --save jest-enzyme
```

Alternatively you may use `yarn`:

```sh
yarn add jest-enzyme
```

Import it in [`src/setupTests.ts`](#initializing-test-environment) to make its matchers available in every test:

```js
import "jest-enzyme";
```

### Using Third Party Assertion Libraries

We recommend that you use `expect()` for assertions and `jest.fn()` for spies. If you are having issues with them please [file those against Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/new), and we’ll fix them. We intend to keep making them better for React, supporting, for example, [pretty-printing React elements as JSX](https://github.com/facebook/jest/pull/1566).

However, if you are used to other libraries, such as [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) and [Sinon](http://sinonjs.org/), or if you have existing code using them that you’d like to port over, you can import them normally like this:

```js
import sinon from "sinon";
import { expect } from "chai";
```

and then use them in your tests like you normally do.

### Initializing Test Environment

> Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.4.0` and higher.

If your app uses a browser API that you need to mock in your tests or if you just need a global setup before running your tests, add a `src/setupTests.ts` to your project. It will be automatically executed before running your tests.

For example:

#### `src/setupTests.ts`

```ts
const localStorageMock = {
  getItem: jest.fn(),
  setItem: jest.fn(),
  clear: jest.fn()
};
global.localStorage = localStorageMock;
```

> Note: Keep in mind that if you decide to "eject" before creating `src/setupTests.js`, the resulting `package.json` file won't contain any reference to it, so you should manually create the property `setupTestFrameworkScriptFile` in the configuration for Jest, something like the following:

> ```js
> "jest": {
>   // ...
>   "setupTestFrameworkScriptFile": "<rootDir>/src/setupTests.js"
>  }
> ```

### Focusing and Excluding Tests

You can replace `it()` with `xit()` to temporarily exclude a test from being executed.<br>
Similarly, `fit()` lets you focus on a specific test without running any other tests.

### Coverage Reporting

Jest has an integrated coverage reporter that works well with ES6 and requires no configuration.<br>
Run `npm test -- --coverage` (note extra `--` in the middle) to include a coverage report like this:

![coverage report](http://i.imgur.com/5bFhnTS.png)

Note that tests run much slower with coverage so it is recommended to run it separately from your normal workflow.

#### Configuration

The default Jest coverage configuration can be overriden by adding any of the following supported keys to a Jest config in your package.json.

Supported overrides:

- [`collectCoverageFrom`](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/configuration.html#collectcoveragefrom-array)
- [`coverageReporters`](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/configuration.html#coveragereporters-array-string)
- [`coverageThreshold`](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/configuration.html#coveragethreshold-object)
- [`snapshotSerializers`](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/configuration.html#snapshotserializers-array-string)
- [`moduleNameMapper`](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/configuration.html#modulenamemapper-object-string-string)

Example package.json:

```json
{
  "name": "your-package",
  "jest": {
    "collectCoverageFrom": [
      "src/**/*.{js,jsx}",
      "!<rootDir>/node_modules/",
      "!<rootDir>/path/to/dir/"
    ],
    "coverageThreshold": {
      "global": {
        "branches": 90,
        "functions": 90,
        "lines": 90,
        "statements": 90
      }
    },
    "coverageReporters": ["text"],
    "snapshotSerializers": ["my-serializer-module"],
    "moduleNameMapper": {
      "^~/(.*)$": "<rootDir>/src/$1"
    }
  }
}
```

Note that customizing the `moduleNameMapper` configuration will override the default (`{ '^react-native$': 'react-native-web' }`).

### Continuous Integration

By default `npm test` runs the watcher with interactive CLI. However, you can force it to run tests once and finish the process by setting an environment variable called `CI`.

When creating a build of your application with `npm run build` linter warnings are not checked by default. Like `npm test`, you can force the build to perform a linter warning check by setting the environment variable `CI`. If any warnings are encountered then the build fails.

Popular CI servers already set the environment variable `CI` by default but you can do this yourself too:

### On CI servers

#### Travis CI

1. Following the [Travis Getting started](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/) guide for syncing your GitHub repository with Travis. You may need to initialize some settings manually in your [profile](https://travis-ci.org/profile) page.
1. Add a `.travis.yml` file to your git repository.

```
language: node_js
node_js:
  - 6
cache:
  directories:
    - node_modules
script:
  - npm run build
  - npm test
```

1. Trigger your first build with a git push.
1. [Customize your Travis CI Build](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build/) if needed.

#### CircleCI

Follow [this article](https://medium.com/@knowbody/circleci-and-zeits-now-sh-c9b7eebcd3c1) to set up CircleCI with a Create React App project.

### On your own environment

##### Windows (cmd.exe)

```cmd
set CI=true&&npm test
```

```cmd
set CI=true&&npm run build
```

(Note: the lack of whitespace is intentional.)

##### Windows (Powershell)

```Powershell
($env:CI = $true) -and (npm test)
```

```Powershell
($env:CI = $true) -and (npm run build)
```

##### Linux, macOS (Bash)

```bash
CI=true npm test
```

```bash
CI=true npm run build
```

The test command will force Jest to run tests once instead of launching the watcher.

> If you find yourself doing this often in development, please [file an issue](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/new) to tell us about your use case because we want to make watcher the best experience and are open to changing how it works to accommodate more workflows.

The build command will check for linter warnings and fail if any are found.

### Disabling jsdom

By default, the `package.json` of the generated project looks like this:

```js
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test --env=jsdom"
```

If you know that none of your tests depend on [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom), you can safely remove `--env=jsdom`, and your tests will run faster:

```diff
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
-   "test": "react-scripts test --env=jsdom"
+   "test": "react-scripts test"
```

To help you make up your mind, here is a list of APIs that **need jsdom**:

- Any browser globals like `window` and `document`
- [`ReactDOM.render()`](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/top-level-api.html#reactdom.render)

In contrast, **jsdom is not needed** for the following APIs:

- [`TestUtils.createRenderer()`](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/test-utils.html#shallow-rendering) (shallow rendering)
- [`shallow()`](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/shallow.html) in [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/index.html)

Finally, jsdom is also not needed for [snapshot testing](http://facebook.github.io/jest/blog/2016/07/27/jest-14.html).

### Snapshot Testing

Snapshot testing is a feature of Jest that automatically generates text snapshots of your components and saves them on the disk so if the UI output changes, you get notified without manually writing any assertions on the component output. [Read more about snapshot testing.](http://facebook.github.io/jest/blog/2016/07/27/jest-14.html)

### Editor Integration

If you use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), there is a [Jest extension](https://github.com/orta/vscode-jest) which works with Create React App out of the box. This provides a lot of IDE-like features while using a text editor: showing the status of a test run with potential fail messages inline, starting and stopping the watcher automatically, and offering one-click snapshot updates.

## Debugging Tests

There are various ways to setup a debugger for your Jest tests. We cover debugging in Chrome and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

> Note: debugging tests requires Node 8 or higher.

### Debugging Tests in Chrome

Add the following to the `scripts` section in your project's `package.json`

```json
"scripts": {
    "test:debug": "react-scripts --inspect-brk test --runInBand --env=jsdom"
  }
```

Place `debugger;` statements in any test and run:

```bash
$ npm run test:debug
```

This will start running your Jest tests, but pause before executing to allow a debugger to attach to the process.

Open the following in Chrome

```
about:inspect
```

After opening that link, the Chrome Developer Tools will be displayed. Select `inspect` on your process and a breakpoint will be set at the first line of the react script (this is done simply to give you time to open the developer tools and to prevent Jest from executing before you have time to do so). Click the button that looks like a "play" button in the upper right hand side of the screen to continue execution. When Jest executes the test that contains the debugger statement, execution will pause and you can examine the current scope and call stack.

> Note: the --runInBand cli option makes sure Jest runs test in the same process rather than spawning processes for individual tests. Normally Jest parallelizes test runs across processes but it is hard to debug many processes at the same time.

### Debugging Tests in Visual Studio Code

Debugging Jest tests is supported out of the box for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

Use the following [`launch.json`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_launch-configurations) configuration file:

```
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Debug CRA Tests",
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "runtimeExecutable": "${workspaceRoot}/node_modules/.bin/react-scripts",
      "args": [
        "test",
        "--runInBand",
        "--no-cache",
        "--env=jsdom"
      ],
      "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}",
      "protocol": "inspector",
      "console": "integratedTerminal",
      "internalConsoleOptions": "neverOpen"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Making a Progressive Web App

By default, the production build is a fully functional, offline-first
[Progressive Web App](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/).

Progressive Web Apps are faster and more reliable than traditional web pages, and provide an engaging mobile experience:

- All static site assets are cached so that your page loads fast on subsequent visits, regardless of network connectivity (such as 2G or 3G). Updates are downloaded in the background.
- Your app will work regardless of network state, even if offline. This means your users will be able to use your app at 10,000 feet and on the Subway.
- On mobile devices, your app can be added directly to the user's home screen, app icon and all. You can also re-engage users using web **push notifications**. This eliminates the need for the app store.

The [`sw-precache-webpack-plugin`](https://github.com/goldhand/sw-precache-webpack-plugin)
is integrated into production configuration,
and it will take care of generating a service worker file that will automatically
precache all of your local assets and keep them up to date as you deploy updates.
The service worker will use a [cache-first strategy](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/instant-and-offline/offline-cookbook/#cache-falling-back-to-network)
for handling all requests for local assets, including the initial HTML, ensuring
that your web app is reliably fast, even on a slow or unreliable network.

### Opting Out of Caching

If you would prefer not to enable service workers prior to your initial
production deployment, then remove the call to `serviceWorkerRegistration.register()`
from [`src/index.js`](src/index.js).

If you had previously enabled service workers in your production deployment and
have decided that you would like to disable them for all your existing users,
you can swap out the call to `serviceWorkerRegistration.register()` in
[`src/index.js`](src/index.js) with a call to `serviceWorkerRegistration.unregister()`.
After the user visits a page that has `serviceWorkerRegistration.unregister()`,
the service worker will be uninstalled. Note that depending on how `/service-worker.js` is served,
it may take up to 24 hours for the cache to be invalidated.

### Offline-First Considerations

1. Service workers [require HTTPS](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/service-workers#you_need_https),
   although to facilitate local testing, that policy
   [does not apply to `localhost`](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34160509/options-for-testing-service-workers-via-http/34161385#34161385).
   If your production web server does not support HTTPS, then the service worker
   registration will fail, but the rest of your web app will remain functional.

1. Service workers are [not currently supported](https://jakearchibald.github.io/isserviceworkerready/)
   in all web browsers. Service worker registration [won't be attempted](src/registerServiceWorker.js)
   on browsers that lack support.

1. The service worker is only enabled in the [production environment](#deployment),
   e.g. the output of `npm run build`. It's recommended that you do not enable an
   offline-first service worker in a development environment, as it can lead to
   frustration when previously cached assets are used and do not include the latest
   changes you've made locally.

1. If you _need_ to test your offline-first service worker locally, build
   the application (using `npm run build`) and run a simple http server from your
   build directory. After running the build script, `create-react-app` will give
   instructions for one way to test your production build locally and the [deployment instructions](#deployment) have
   instructions for using other methods. _Be sure to always use an
   incognito window to avoid complications with your browser cache._

1. If possible, configure your production environment to serve the generated
   `service-worker.js` [with HTTP caching disabled](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38843970/service-worker-javascript-update-frequency-every-24-hours).
   If that's not possible—[GitHub Pages](#github-pages), for instance, does not
   allow you to change the default 10 minute HTTP cache lifetime—then be aware
   that if you visit your production site, and then revisit again before
   `service-worker.js` has expired from your HTTP cache, you'll continue to get
   the previously cached assets from the service worker. If you have an immediate
   need to view your updated production deployment, performing a shift-refresh
   will temporarily disable the service worker and retrieve all assets from the
   network.

1. Users aren't always familiar with offline-first web apps. It can be useful to
   [let the user know](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/instant-and-offline/offline-ux#inform_the_user_when_the_app_is_ready_for_offline_consumption)
   when the service worker has finished populating your caches (showing a "This web
   app works offline!" message) and also let them know when the service worker has
   fetched the latest updates that will be available the next time they load the
   page (showing a "New content is available; please refresh." message). Showing
   this messages is currently left as an exercise to the developer, but as a
   starting point, you can make use of the logic included in [`src/registerServiceWorker.js`](src/registerServiceWorker.js), which
   demonstrates which service worker lifecycle events to listen for to detect each
   scenario, and which as a default, just logs appropriate messages to the
   JavaScript console.

1. By default, the generated service worker file will not intercept or cache any
   cross-origin traffic, like HTTP [API requests](#integrating-with-an-api-backend),
   images, or embeds loaded from a different domain. If you would like to use a
   runtime caching strategy for those requests, you can [`eject`](#npm-run-eject)
   and then configure the
   [`runtimeCaching`](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/sw-precache#runtimecaching-arrayobject)
   option in the `SWPrecacheWebpackPlugin` section of
   [`webpack.config.prod.js`](../config/webpack.config.prod.js).

## Deployment

`npm run build` creates a `build` directory with a production build of your app. Set up your favorite HTTP server so that a visitor to your site is served `index.html`, and requests to static paths like `/static/js/main.<hash>.js` are served with the contents of the `/static/js/main.<hash>.js` file.

### Static Server

For environments using [Node](https://nodejs.org/), the easiest way to handle this would be to install [serve](https://github.com/zeit/serve) and let it handle the rest:

```sh
npm install -g serve
serve -s build
```

The last command shown above will serve your static site on the port **5000**. Like many of [serve](https://github.com/zeit/serve)’s internal settings, the port can be adjusted using the `-p` or `--port` flags.

Run this command to get a full list of the options available:

```sh
serve -h
```

### Other Solutions

You don’t necessarily need a static server in order to run a Create React App project in production. It works just as fine integrated into an existing dynamic one.

Here’s a programmatic example using [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and [Express](http://expressjs.com/):

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const path = require("path");
const app = express();

app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, "build")));

app.get("/", function(req, res) {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, "build", "index.html"));
});

app.listen(9000);
```

The choice of your server software isn’t important either. Since Create React App is completely platform-agnostic, there’s no need to explicitly use Node.

The `build` folder with static assets is the only output produced by Create React App.

However this is not quite enough if you use client-side routing. Read the next section if you want to support URLs like `/todos/42` in your single-page app.
