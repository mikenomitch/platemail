# TODOs

## Next in Order (don't think, do)

- Deployment strategy

  - Login working on all envs (until k8s)
  - Get psql working locally on k8s

  - Deploy top AWS or GCP

- Super simple phoenix channel connection
  - Working with multiple servers (on k8s)
- Landing page setup (with static-site-generator-webpack-plugin!)
- Swagger docs setup

- Document the well and clean up
- after all of this, add login/signup
  niceness
  - email confirmation on signup
  - reset password
  - single click login

## Backend

- Simple tests

## Frontend

- Add Socket code from Phoenix
- Static public page (w/ snapshot)
- Simple tests

## Ops
