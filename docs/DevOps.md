# DevOps ToDos:

- Get frontend "production" build running on node alone
  - Get this running in a lone docker container - DONE
  - Get this container running as a nomad job
- Get backend running as a Nomad job with Docker
- Locally can run all containers/have single IP to use app
- Locally can swap out K/Vs well
- Get Terraform working with nomad/consul/etc
- Get it up on AWS with RDS

- To explore once this is done:
  - Backend running without Docker (for hot upgrades)
  - Server-Side rendering with Node
    If you cant use Fabio for some reason...
